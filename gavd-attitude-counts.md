# Gavin Davies - Attitude Counts

## What do you wish you'd known?

I left Aberystwyth University in 2001 with first class honours in Computer Science and Geography. I felt fairly confident that I knew a lot about software engineering. I took my first job at a small web company. For a large amount of my time there, I was the only full-time dev in the company. Over the next few months, I learned the skills I would need (basic PhotoShop, ASP classic, HTML and a little CSS) and off I went, building web applications. My work perhaps wasn't my particularly high on my list of priorities*. I was in a rock and roll band, and we had moved to Cardiff as a unit, but work paid the bills and life was fun.

(* work still isn't the be-all and end-all, I just think I'm more diligent about it now!)

I was pretty bright back then, and I could pick things up quite quickly. I started to think I knew it all, and anything I wasn't comfortable with, I kind of glossed over. I had ability and youth, but I did not have a particularly good attitude. I was quite arrogant, despite the fact that, in all honesty, my code quality was actually pretty low! If a dev I work with now committed code with no tests, no use of static analysis, etc, I would want to give that coder some coaching.

In my early career, I could be pretty condescending to clients. I remember once a client asked for a change that I felt violated best practise and I wrote down in my notes, speaking it aloud, "break the user interface". Pretty appalling customer service!

Here's my wishlist:

* I wish I'd known how much I didn't know.
* I wish I hadn't thought I was so "complete" as a software developer.
* I wish I had embraced more humility.
* I wish I had worked harder to find technical community.
* I wish I had treated clients with more respect.

See, nothing on this wishlist is particularly technical, it's all about my attitude and situation.

On the flip side of my own behaviour, I've worked with young guys who have thought they knew it all, and that can really have a "bad apple" effect. It's very hard to work with people that won't be told anything!

## What makes a good attitude for a coder?



Of course, technical skills are absolutely vital for working in the software industry.
